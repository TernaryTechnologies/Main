Hello fellow sportsmen! 

In order to test this grand frontend, run the command 'python manage.py test frontend'

Every test should be in a file beginning with the word 'test', and its class name should begin with the word 'test', and its test method should begin with the word 'test'.
See the file test_urls for an example.
